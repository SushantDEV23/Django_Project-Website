# Djnago_Project
This is a Planting website which is Coded in Python using Django framework. HTML, CSS and JavaScript is also used but the back-end of this website is fully coded in Django.
Django provides us an extensive readibilty of the code and because of its ORM(Object Relational Mapping) it provides a great abstraction level over Query which we pass to create Database Tables.
